# steam-donation-bot

This is probably the most basic bot you can ever get. The bot accepts all trade offers except when the bot gives items.\n

## How to set it up:

###### Make sure you have [node.js](http://destyy.com/q11WUe) installed

Open your console and get into the bot's folder\n
Enter the command `npm install` that will install the requirements for the bot\n

Open main.js as a text file\n
Enter your account name and password\n
Get your shared secret:\n
  [iOS](http://destyy.com/q11mdZ)\n
  [Android](http://destyy.com/q11Qpk)\n
  Or you can use Steam Desktop Authenticator\n
And copy that to `SteamTotp.generateAuthCode('')` between the quotation marks\n
And after that double click runbot.bat\n
